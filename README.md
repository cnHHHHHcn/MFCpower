This project is designed to display laptop battery and power status information.
## Features
1.Dynamically display laptop battery level, power state (e.g., charging/discharging), and other relevant information.
2.Allows users to control the state of the NumLock, CapsLock, and ScrollLock keys directly from this application.
## Current Limitations
A key limitation of the current Shortcomings is the inability to create a system tray icon within the MFC framework. Consequently, it is not possible to display the laptop battery, power status and keyboard lock key states in the system tray area.
We are actively working to resolve this limitation and would greatly appreciate any suggestions or assistance from the community.
